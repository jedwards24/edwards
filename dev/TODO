# TODO

## General

+ Add devtools to my .rprofile as recommended in R packages.
+ Add namespace when calling edwards functions?
+ Checks on all inputs.
    + `predict` in `rang`. Is adding `ranger::predict.ranger()` correct?
+ add importFrom :=
  - can't find how to import '.' so have removed it from code instead.
+ Add markdown formatting to docs?
+ Check use of `reorder()` in `prop_ci()`.
+ NEWS file and version increment.

## Existing functions

+ Possible name change: find_similar() --> similar_cols() or compare_???
+ ??var_summary() - add na_string arg to include in missing count
+ glmnet tools (not working correctly). Add tests.

## New functions

These may already be in dev_code().

+ pdp functions (already written but not in package)
+ key function
+ benchmarking over arguments
+ ??Add count_sheets() - see func google doc. Used in treat....Prob won't do this unless I use it anywhere else
+ calibration plot for binary responses - split preds into deciles and get mean response for each. Plot & table.
+ simplify_datetime()
+ variable checking functions:
    + check all dates for simple datetimes and 1899/1900 dates.
    + possible dates as characters
    + count prop integers in numeric cols.
    + single value or single & NA.
    + Binary value columns.
+ Non-missing head function.
+ Convert Excel dates from char or numeric: as.Date(as.numeric(vec), origin = "1899-12-30")

## Package check issues

+ '::' or ':::' imports not declared from: 'rlang' 'tidyselect'
  - this could be `contains()` and enquo() etc.
+ Missing or unexported object: 'edwards::oob_errors'.
  - this is an internal function and is not exported. I have removed the edwards:: but not sure what is correct.
+ - update... `:::` is used to access internal functions. But when I put it in I got:
      "There are ::: calls to the package's namespace in its code. A package almost never needs to use ::: for its own        objects"
+ bindings for df cols. Need to use .data$ for these
+ add namespace to some dplyr funcs: n(), na.omit(), bind_cols()
